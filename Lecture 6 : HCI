# Context-Aware Systems vs. Traditional Systems

The image illustrates two key concepts in system design:

## Traditional System Structure

*   Takes an explicit input and produces an explicit output.
*   It does *not* consider external contextual factors.

## Context-Aware System

*   Takes explicit input but also considers *implicit context* before producing an explicit output.

**Implicit Context Includes:**

*   State of the user (e.g., location, preferences, activity)
*   State of the physical environment (e.g., temperature, lighting)
*   State of the computing system (e.g., battery level, network status)
*   History of user-computer interactions (e.g., past behaviors, patterns)

## Real-World Examples of Context-Aware Systems

*   ‚úî Smart Assistants (e.g., Alexa, Google Assistant) ‚Äì Adjust responses based on user location, time, and preferences.
*   ‚úî Smart Homes ‚Äì Automatically control lighting and temperature based on occupancy.
*   ‚úî Adaptive User Interfaces ‚Äì Change UI elements based on the user's device, vision preferences, or past interactions.

# Context in Computing and HCI

This slide discusses Context and its importance in computing and human-computer interaction (HCI).

## Key Takeaways

**1. What is Context?**

Context refers to situational information that influences user interactions. The image of people walking in a busy urban environment suggests dynamic contextual factors such as location, activity, and social setting.

**2. Examples of Context**

Context includes:

*   User identity (Who is interacting?)
*   Location (Where is the user?)
*   Date/Time (When is the interaction happening?)
*   Environment (Physical or digital surroundings)
*   Emotional state (Mood or sentiment analysis)
*   Focus of attention (What is the user engaged with?)
*   User preferences & behavioral patterns (Past actions, settings)
*   Browsing history & calendar events (Relevant for recommendations)
*   Relationships & interactions (Phone calls, contacts, social connections)

**3. Relevance of Context Information**

Context-aware systems enhance user experience by adapting to real-world scenarios, such as:

*   ‚úî Scheduling meetings based on availability
*   ‚úî Adjusting behavior for a job interview vs. shopping
*   ‚úî Personalizing recommendations for tourists vs. locals
