# Detailed Explanation of 802.11 Infrastructure Network and Wi-Fi Scanning

This image provides a detailed breakdown of the 802.11 network architecture and Wi-Fi scanning mechanisms used to connect devices to access points (APs). Let‚Äôs analyze each section in depth.

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ 802.11 Infrastructure Network Architecture

Wi-Fi networks operate in two main modes:

* **Infrastructure Mode** ‚Äì Uses Access Points (APs) to manage connections.
* **Ad-Hoc Mode** ‚Äì Devices communicate directly without an AP.

This image focuses on the Infrastructure Mode, which consists of the following key components:

### üìå Key Components of Infrastructure Mode

| Component             | Description                                                                    |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Station (STA)         | Any Wi-Fi-enabled device (laptop, smartphone) that connects to the wireless network. |
| Basic Service Set (BSS) | A group of devices (STAs) communicating using the same AP and radio frequency. |
| Access Point (AP)     | The central device in a BSS that connects STAs to the distribution system (network). |
| Portal                | Bridges the wireless network to other wired networks (e.g., Ethernet LAN).      |
| Distribution System (DS) | Connects multiple BSSs to form a larger Extended Service Set (ESS).          |

### üîó How the Infrastructure Network Works

* Stations (STAs) connect to an AP using Wi-Fi.
* The AP manages communication between STAs within the same BSS.
* Multiple APs can be linked via the Distribution System (DS) to create a larger network (ESS).
* The Portal connects the wireless LAN (Wi-Fi) to wired networks (e.g., Ethernet, Internet).

### üõ† Key Features of Infrastructure Mode

* Centralized management via APs.
* Scalability by adding more APs to extend coverage.
* Better security and access control than Ad-Hoc Mode.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Wi-Fi (802.11) Scanning

When a device wants to connect to a Wi-Fi network, it must discover available APs. This is done through scanning, which happens in two ways: Passive and Active Scanning.

### üìå Passive Scanning (Listening for AP Beacons)

* APs periodically send "Beacon Frames" containing network details (SSID, supported speeds, security).
* The device (H1) listens for these beacons.
* Once it detects an AP, it sends an Association Request.
* The AP replies with an Association Response, completing the connection.
* ‚úî **Best for:** Power saving, background scanning.

### üìå Active Scanning (Sending Probe Requests)

* The device (H1) actively sends a Probe Request to search for nearby APs.
* All APs within range respond with a Probe Response.
* The device selects the best AP and initiates an Association Request.
* The AP acknowledges with an Association Response, completing the connection.
* ‚úî **Best for:** Faster network discovery, immediate connections.

### üí° Passive vs. Active Scanning

| Feature           | Passive Scanning          | Active Scanning           |
| ----------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| How it works      | Device listens for AP beacons | Device sends Probe Requests |
| Power Consumption | Low (saves battery)       | Higher (sends extra requests) |
| Speed             | Slower                    | Faster                    |
| Usage             | Background scanning       | Immediate connection      |

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Summary

* 802.11 Infrastructure Mode uses Access Points (APs) to connect Wi-Fi devices to a larger Distribution System (DS).
* BSS (Basic Service Set) refers to a group of devices connected to a single AP, while ESS (Extended Service Set) connects multiple BSSs.
* Passive Scanning involves listening for AP beacons, whereas Active Scanning involves sending probe requests.
* Active Scanning is faster but consumes more power, while Passive Scanning is more efficient for battery life.

# üì° What is Ad-Hoc Routing?

- Adhoc routing in IoT WiFi networks refers to communication between devices in a decentralized, infrastructure-less manner, where each device (or node) can act as both a host and a router.
- No fixed infrastructure like routers or access points.
- Routes can change dynamically due to mobility.
- Packets may take multiple hops to reach the destination.
- Scalability: Supports a large number of connected devices.
- An ad-hoc routing protocol is a convention that controls how nodes decide which way to route packets between computing devices in a mobile ad-hoc network

- **Neighbor Discovery** is the foundation of most adhoc protocols in which : <br>

Nodes broadcast periodic messages (e.g., beacon packets) to detect nearby devices.
Helps build a "neighbor table", allowing nodes to learn about their 2-hop neighborhood (direct and indirect connections).



## üìå Real-World Applications

* ‚úîÔ∏è **Proactive:** Military mesh networks, corporate setups.
* ‚úîÔ∏è **Reactive:** IoT devices, emergency communication.
* ‚úîÔ∏è **Geographic:** UAV (drones), vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs).

# üì° Proactive "Link-State" Routing Algorithms
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f7443c97-d7a2-4739-afef-17a78c5353c1)

This image explains how Link-State Routing works in proactive protocols, focusing on topology discovery and route updates.

## üõ§ How Do Link-State Algorithms Work?

* Every node shares its link information with its neighbors.
* Over time, all nodes can build a complete map of the network.
* Assumes the topology remains stable long enough for all nodes to sync and have same information available

## üîÑ How Link Updates Work?

* Whenever a link changes state (goes up/down), affected nodes:
    * Send "hello" packets to detect the change.
    * Propagate the update to neighboring nodes.
* Eventually, the entire network is updated.

## üîó Example of Link-State Update (New Link A‚ÜîC)
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/45232f40-064d-4533-b3b5-6421cac36a35)

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Initial State:** Nodes A, B, C, and D have a common network topology.
2Ô∏è‚É£ **New Link A‚ÜîC is Established.**
3Ô∏è‚É£ **Nodes A and C share the new link with their neighbors.**
4Ô∏è‚É£ **Update propagates through the network until all nodes learn about A‚ÜîC.**

## üåç Advantages of Link-State Routing

* ‚úîÔ∏è **Faster Convergence** ‚Äì All nodes quickly sync topology changes and rapidly update to network changes
* ‚úîÔ∏è **More Accurate Routes** ‚Äì Each node has a global network view.
* ‚úîÔ∏è **Efficient for Large Networks** ‚Äì Better than distance-vector in complex topologies.

## üöÄ Examples of Link-State Protocols:

* OLSR (Optimized Link State Routing) ‚Äì Used in ad-hoc networks.
* OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) ‚Äì Common in wired networks.
# üîÑ Reactive Routing: Dynamic Source Routing (DSR)

DSR is a reactive (on-demand) routing protocol used in ad-hoc networks. It only searches for a route when necessary, rather than maintaining a full routing table like proactive protocols.

## üõ§ How Does DSR Work?

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Route Request (RREQ) Broadcast

When a source node (S) wants to send data to a destination node (D), it broadcasts an RREQ.
This request floods through the network until it reaches the destination or an intermediate node that knows the route.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Route Reply (RREP) Unicast

The destination node (D) sends an RREP back to the source along the reverse path.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Source Routing

Every message slong the route carries the entire path to help the intermediate nodes what to do with the message.
Intermediate nodes use this information to forward packets.

## üîç Route Discovery in DSR
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0eb2b4d0-0867-495f-9280-d75157da047f)
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/43bcaa22-e183-49fc-9128-d5099041151d)


üîµ Blue nodes in the diagram received RREQ for D from S.
## üöÄ How Route Discovery Works in DSR

### üîπ Step 1: Source Broadcasts RREQ

The source node (S) initiates a broadcast transmission of the Route Request (RREQ) packet to find a path to the destination (D).
RREQ packet floods through entire network until it reaches destination.
Each intermediate node forwards the RREQ to its neighbors until it reaches the destination.

### üîπ Step 2: Appending Identifiers to RREQ

- Every node that forwards the RREQ appends its identifier to the packet.
- This helps create a record of the path taken.
- Packet header size grows with route length
**Example:** If S sends an RREQ via E, the packet/message now carries the path [S, E].

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Potential for Collision

### üî¥ Issue: Redundant RREQ Transmission

Since RREQ is broadcasted, nodes may receive it from multiple neighbors.
**Example:** Node H receives RREQ from both C and B, leading to redundant transmissions and potential collisions.
### üî¥ Solution:

Nodes discard duplicate RREQs to avoid unnecessary retransmissions.

‚úî Once S gets the RREP, it starts sending data.

## üåç Advantages of DSR

‚úÖ **On-demand Routing** ‚Äì Reduces overhead since routes are only discovered when needed.
‚úÖ **Loop-Free Routing** ‚Äì Source carries the route, preventing loops.
‚úÖ **No Periodic Updates** ‚Äì Saves bandwidth compared to proactive routing protocols.

## üî¥ Challenges:

* High overhead for large networks (entire path is included in each packet).
* Latency due to route discovery time.

## üöÄ Where is DSR Used?

üîπ Mobile Ad-Hoc Networks (MANETs)
üîπ Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs)
üîπ Vehicular Ad-Hoc Networks (VANETs)





## üîç Summary

‚úî RREQ floods through the network until it reaches the destination.
‚úî Each node appends its identifier to track the path.
‚úî Redundant broadcasts can cause collisions and must be managed efficiently.
# üìå Proactive vs Reactive Routing

Routing protocols in ad-hoc networks can be categorized into two types:

## ‚ö° Reactive (On-Demand) Routing

‚úÖ Establishes routes only when needed (reduces overhead).
‚úÖ Stores entire route in each message (can increase message size).
‚úÖ Floods the network with route requests (RREQs), which can cause network congestion.
‚ùå Example: DSR (Dynamic Source Routing) and AODV (Ad hoc On-Demand Distance Vector Routing).

## üîÑ Proactive (Table-Driven) Routing

‚úÖ Maintains routing tables with precomputed routes.
‚úÖ No delay in route discovery, as routes are always available.
‚úÖ Continuously exchanges route updates between nodes.
‚ùå Overhead due to constant updates, even if no traffic exists.
‚ùå Route information may become outdated in dynamic networks.
‚ùå Example: OLSR (Optimized Link State Routing) and Link Table Algorithm and DSDV (Destination-Sequenced Distance Vector Routing).

## üó∫Ô∏è Geographic Routing

‚úî Nodes use location information to make routing decisions.
‚úî Requires nodes to know their location, as well as that of their neighbors and destination.
‚úî Can use GPS (Global Positioning System) or a Location Broker for positional data.
üí° Benefit: Scalability in large networks, as decisions are made locally rather than maintaining full topology.
üí° Example: Geocasting and unicast location based routing.

## Unicast Location-Based Routing

## Overview
Unicast location-based routing is a technique used in wireless networks where data packets are forwarded based on the geographical position of the destination.

## Key Features
- **One Single Destination**: The routing algorithm ensures that packets are sent to a single, specific destination.
- **Localized Decision-Making**: Each forwarding node makes decisions based on the location of the destination and its immediate neighbors.
- **Greedy Forwarding**: Nodes forward packets to the neighbor closest to the destination, optimizing efficiency.

## Challenges
- **Voids or Holes**: Packets may reach a node that has no closer neighbors to the destination, leading to transmission failure or delays.
- **Limited Node Communication**: If nodes are sparsely distributed, routing efficiency may decrease.

## Illustration
A source node transmits packets through intermediary nodes, each making forwarding decisions based on proximity to the destination. If an area lacks neighboring nodes, packets may be trapped in a routing void.

## Conclusion
Unicast location-based routing is a powerful approach for wireless and sensor networks, but challenges like voids need to be addressed with advanced algorithms to ensure reliable packet delivery.

# Geocasting

## Overview
Geocasting is a communication technique in which a packet is sent to all or some nodes within a specific geographic region. This method is useful in applications where location-based communication is required.

## Key Concepts
- **Packet transmission**: The packet is not broadcast to all nodes in the network but only to those in a designated geographic area.
- **Example Use Case**: Queries sent to all sensors within a geographic area of interest, such as environmental monitoring or disaster response.

## Routing Challenges
- **Propagation of a packet near the target region**:
  - Similar to unicast routing.
  - Efficient routing strategies are needed to direct the packet toward the target.
- **Distribution of packets within the target region**:
  - Similar to flooding.
  - Ensures that all relevant nodes within the specified geographic area receive the packet.

## Illustration

An illustration (as seen in the provided image) typically shows a network where a source node sends a packet that propagates towards a predefined geographic area, and then the packet is distributed within that region.

## Applications of Geocasting
- Location-based services
- Sensor networks for environmental monitoring
- Emergency and disaster response communication
- Vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs)

## Conclusion
Geocasting provides an efficient way to limit message propagation to relevant areas, reducing network congestion and improving communication efficiency. However, designing effective routing protocols remains a challenge due to factors like mobility, interference, and network topology changes.
